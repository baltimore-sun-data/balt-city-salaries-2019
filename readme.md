# Baltimore city salaries fiscal year 2019

## Baltimore Sun analysis

By [Christine Zhang](mailto:czhang@baltsun.com)

The Baltimore Sun analyzed the fiscal year 2019 city government salaries figures [recently posted](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Government/Baltimore-City-Employee-Salaries-FY2019/6xv6-e66h/data) on Open Baltimore, the city's open data website. The analysis provided information for an October 7, 2019 Baltimore Sun story titled "Baltimoreâ€™s highest-paid city employee is police sergeant charged with assaulting bystander" (print headline: "Sgt. charged in assault leads city in pay.")
